# Contributing

First, thank you for contributing to `testcontainers-rs`.

Most likely, your contribution is about adding support for a new docker image. For this, please check the [README.md](images/README.md) inside the `images/` folder.

## General conventions for contributions

- Please make sure your code is formatted with `cargo fmt` BEFORE you commit. We would like to avoid commits that only reformat code.
- All crates (except the meta-crate) in the testcontainers-rs ecosystem are prefixed with `tc_`. Please follow this convention.
